# Mind Leap
MindLeap takes the form of a Mental Wellness Website

- Otherwise Mind-Motion to emphasise the animation aspects of the website

## Tech Stack
⭐ Next.js

⭐ TypeScript

⭐ TailwindCSS

⭐ React Icons

⭐ React Tabs

⭐ Framer Motion

## Features
➡️ Sleek and modern template designed to showcase therapy help

➡️ One page, dark theme layout

➡️ Features a responsive and engaging design

## Notes
I had aimed to utilise next.js for server-sided rendering capacities. However,

1. most components utilised react hook components so it required us to use the 'use client' directive.

2. regardless of whether they utilised react hook components, to apply animation from framer motion to each component requires the 'use client' directive.
